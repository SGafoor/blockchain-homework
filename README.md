# Blockchain-Homework
## Background
I have landed a new job at ZBank, a small, innovative bank that is interested in exploring what block chain technology can do for them and their customers. My first project at the company is to set up a private test net that my team of developers can use to explore potentials for block chain at ZBank. I have decided on setting up a test net because:
1.	There is no real money involved, which will give your team of developers the freedom to experiment.
2.	Test nets allows for offline development.
Tokens inherently have no value here, so we will provide pre-configured accounts and nodes for easy setup.

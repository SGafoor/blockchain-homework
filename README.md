# Blockchain-Homework
## Background
I have landed a new job at ZBank, a small, innovative bank that is interested in exploring what block chain technology can do for them and their customers. My first project at the company is to set up a private test net that my team of developers can use to explore potentials for block chain at ZBank. I have decided on setting up a test net because:
1.	There is no real money involved, which will give your team of developers the freedom to experiment.
2.	Test nets *allows* for offline development.
Tokens inherently have no value here, so we will provide pre-configured accounts and nodes for easy setup.

Once you download the installer, open and follow the installation wizard’s commands.

** There will be a tutorial available when you first open the program; it is strongly advised to not skip through it. 
On the initial download there may be security alerts advising you that it is an unidentified application. You should be prompted to allow the download regardless.

## GO ETHEREUM
Next we’ll be installing Go Ethereum:
1.	Using this link https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/ open a new tab in your browser and scroll down to “Stable Releases.”
2.	Please install ‘Geth & tools 1.9.7’. This is version specific, any other version ***WILL NOT*** work.

a.	You need to know if you’re running a 32 bit operating system or a 64 bit. This information can be found in your settings folder. 
3.	After downloading the tools archive, open your "Downloads" folder, and you will find a file named geth-alltools-darwin-amd64-1.9.7-a718daa6.tar.gz in OS X, and a file called geth-alltools-windows-amd64-1.9.7-a718daa6.zip in Windows. Note that the last numbers in the filename could vary depending on the last build available.
4.	Decompress the archive in the location of your preference on your computer's hard drive, and rename the containing folder as Blockchain-Tools. We recommend using a location that can be easily accessed from the terminal window like the user's home directory.


*Great now that everything is installed and running, let’s begin shall we?*
Open up your MyCrypto application and begin the login portion.

Once that's completed, choose an address for your wallet and save the address in the same note pad file.
